Pair Programming Practice

You will work in pairs
 * First create a project on Gitub (follow the usual instructions)
 * Clone the project on one's computer
 * Both memebers will be coding in one's computer
 * When they decide, they will commit the code, push it to a repository created by themselves and then the other member will fork it, clone it and start making modifications on the other's computer

It doesnt' matter in which computer you are working, both of you will be all the time discussing the code and making modifications on just one computer
